/* =====================================================================
   TeamLink — backend integration layer
   =====================================================================

   This is the only file added to the prototype. It changes WHERE data
   comes from. It does not touch the DOM, the CSS, or any render function.

   THE CENTRAL PROBLEM
   -------------------
   The prototype reads data synchronously, inline, inside template
   literals. `DATA.jobById(id)` alone appears 163 times, always as a plain
   expression. Making those async would mean rewriting all 19 page
   renderers and most of the 691 functions — the rebuild the requirements
   forbid.

   THE APPROACH
   ------------
   `DATA` stays exactly what it is: a synchronous in-memory cache. Only
   its edges change.

     boot    one await, before the first paint, fills DATA from /api/bootstrap
     reads   unchanged — all ~700 synchronous call sites keep working
     writes  intercepted, sent to the API, then reconciled into the cache

   Two interception seams are used, both of which the prototype already
   uses on itself:

     1. Function wrapping (`const prev = window.fn; window.fn = ...`).
        The prototype does this in a dozen places already.

     2. localStorage. Every persistence path in the prototype funnels
        through a known key — `persistPosting()` writes both job creates
        AND edits through `teamlink_posted_jobs_v1`, for example. Shimming
        localStorage therefore catches flows without needing to know the
        name of every function that triggers them.

   RULES OBSERVED THROUGHOUT
   -------------------------
   - Never edit or replace a render function.
   - Never reassign a DATA array. Existing code holds references to them
     and monkey-patches their `.push`; arrays are refilled IN PLACE.
   - Never invent data. If the server says no, the UI says so.

   *
   * The standalone export is different: it is opened from a plain static

   *
   *   window.TL_API_BASE   an explicit base, e.g. 'https://jobs.example.com/api'
   *   window.TL_API_PORT   just the API's port on THIS hostname
   *   ?api=<base>          the same thing from the address bar, no rebuild
   *
   * TL_API_PORT is built from `location.hostname` rather than a fixed host
   * on purpose. Session cookies are SameSite=Lax, which ignores the port but
   * not the host: a page on localhost:5183 calling 127.0.0.1:4323 is
   * cross-site and the cookie would be dropped, so you would sign in and
   * immediately appear signed out. Same hostname, any port, works.

   * 1. Transport
   *
   * Every call the UI makes goes through request(). What it SAYS when a
   * call fails matters as much as the call itself.
   *
   * The first version of this file mapped every fetch rejection to one
   * message - "You appear to be offline - check your connection" - and
   * that is wrong in the two cases that actually happen, both of which
   * leave the connection perfectly healthy:
   *
   *   file://   web/index.html opened by double-clicking it. The page has
   *             no http origin, so fetch('/api/bootstrap') resolves to
   *             file:///C:/api/bootstrap and the browser refuses the
   *             scheme outright. There is no server to reach, and the app
   *             is empty: DATA.jobs is 0.
   *   API down  the page loaded from the server but the API is not
   *             answering (not started, crashed, nginx down, wrong port).
   *
   * In both, navigator.onLine is true. Telling the user to check their
   * connection sends them to fix something that is not broken, and the
   * message repeated once per failed call - boot, then login, then apply -
   * which is the stack of identical toasts in the bug report.
   *
   * Failures are now classified, the offline wording is used ONLY when

   * 6b. Registration: say WHICH field, and agree with the server
   *
   * Reported as "uploading a resume breaks Create account". The resume was
   * not the cause. Two faults combined to make it look like one:
   *
   * 1. THE RULES DISAGREED. validateRegisterForm() accepts a password of
   *    six characters (prototype.html:2470, and the field's own hint says
   *    "At least 6 characters"). The server requires EIGHT, with at least
   *    one letter and one digit. So a password like "Sravanthi" passes the
   *    form, enables the button, and is then refused.
   *
   * 2. THE REASON WAS DISCARDED. The API answers with the field and the
   *    reason - {"password":"Password must contain at least one letter and
   *    one number."} - but say() shows only the generic sentence, so the
   *    candidate sees "Please check the highlighted fields and try again."
   *    with nothing highlighted and no idea which field. Having just
   *    uploaded a resume, the obvious conclusion is that the resume did it.
   *
   * Neither is fixed by relaxing anything: the client now applies the
   * SAME rule as the server, states it, and when the server does reject
   * something the actual message is shown against the actual field.

   * 7b. Resume reading
   *
   * The prototype read resumes in the browser, lazy-loading mammoth and
   * pdf.js from cdnjs. The API's Content-Security-Policy does not allow
   * that origin, so both were refused, and every DOCX and PDF produced the
   * same sentence: "Something went wrong reading this file". The console
   * said `Refused to load ... violates the following Content Security
   * Policy directive`, but nothing surfaced it.
   *
   * Extraction now happens on the server (api/src/resume/), which is also
   * where .doc can actually be parsed and where an AI key can live. The
   * SCREEN IS UNCHANGED: the same button, the same status line, the same
   * "AI Extracted" tags, the same paste-text fallback. Only the source of
   * the text and the fields is different.
   *
   * Requirement 7 needed no work here - applyExtractedField() already
   * refuses to overwrite a field the candidate typed, offering
   * `AI found "X" - click to use` instead. That behaviour is reused as-is.

   * 9b. Replacing the resume from the profile
   *
   * handleResumeFileSelected() (prototype.html:3662) runs the profile
   * page's "Upload resume" button. Two things were wrong with it once
   * there was a real backend:
   *
   *   THE FILE WENT NOWHERE. Like the registration upload before it, the
   *   bytes were never sent, so candidates.resume_file kept pointing at
   *   the OLD resume - or at nothing. A candidate who replaced their CV
   *   went on applying with the previous one.
   *
   *   THE EXTRACTION WAS NOT AN EXTRACTION. It called
   *   buildResumeExtraction(cand, file.name), which assembles the "parsed"
   *   fields from the candidate record that is already on screen. Upload a
   *   blank file and it reports your existing details back to you as
   *   freshly extracted. The file name was the only thing that came from
   *   the file.
   *
   * Both now go through the same server path registration uses: the file
   * is read by api/src/resume/, its real fields fill the review form, and
   * the bytes are stored against the candidate. The review screen, its
   * progress steps and its confirm flow are untouched.

   * 19. Every channel a candidate hears from us on, on the recruiter's
   *     own screen
   *
   * Two gaps, one screen.
   *
   * FIRST: email had a settings page and the other three did not. SMS,
   * WhatsApp and the calling agent already send at every stage - the
   * same dispatch, the same templates, the same delivery log - but with
   * no credentials they record `not_configured`, which reads like a
   * fault rather than a setting nobody has filled in. "She got no SMS"
   * had no answer anywhere a recruiter could reach.
   *
   * SECOND: the calling agent's configuration existed for an admin only,
   * so the recruiter placing the calls could not see what the agent
   * would say, which languages it answers in, whether it discloses that
   * it is an AI, or why a call is not going out.
   *
   * This is a TAB on the existing Email / SMS / IVR screen. Not a new
   * module, not a new menu: same tab strip, same panels, same classes,
   * same buttons.
   *
   * ONE DELIBERATE DIFFERENCE from the usual provider-settings page:
   * there is no API key box anywhere on it. Credentials are environment
   * variables on the server. This screen reports whether they are
   * present and names the ones that are missing - it never receives,
   * displays or stores a value. A page that takes an API key in a text
   * field hands it to everybody who can open the developer tools.
   *
   * A recruiter reads. Only an admin writes, and that is enforced by the
   * API and by row-level security, not by hiding a button.

   *                  ALREADY prints beside every row
   *

   * DISTANCES ARE NOT HARD-CODED. What is added here is coordinates -
   * latitude and longitude, geographic facts - and the distance is
   * computed by the haversine already in the file
   * (TL_LOC.distanceKm). Change a coordinate and every distance derived
   * from it changes with it.
   *
   * These cover the metros TeamLink recruits in. A locality that is not
   * listed behaves exactly as it did before: it is still typeable, still
   * matches by name, and simply has no distance beside it. Full national
   * coverage needs a geocoding service, which is a network call and a
