/**
 * The interview score is earned, and it reaches the recruiter's screen.
 *
 *     node tools/verify-interview-score.mjs      (dev server on :4323)
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE from verify-interview-end-to-end.mjs. That one
 * drives the real screen, which is the right way to prove the RESULT
 * travels - but a headless browser has no speech recognition, so every
 * question is skipped and the honest score is zero. Zero proves the
 * plumbing and says nothing about the scoring.
 *
 * This one sends real transcripts through the same endpoints the browser
 * uses, and asks the only question that matters about a score: does it
 * depend on what was actually said?
 *
 * So it runs TWO candidates through the same requirement:
 *
 *   one who answers each question using the words that question is
 *   looking for, and
 *   one who answers every question with the same irrelevant paragraph
 *
 * and asserts the first scores materially higher than the second. A
 * scorer that returns a constant, or that rewards talking at length,
 * fails here - and both of those were real behaviours in this file's
 * history: an untranscribed answer used to earn up to 72 out of 100 for
 * the length of the noise, and an off-topic one up to 24 for using
 * enough words.
 *
 * Both candidates are on a domain reserved for testing, so nothing is
 * emailed, and both are removed at the end.
