/**
 * A candidate who finishes an AI interview is emailed about it.
 *
 *     node tools/verify-interview-email.mjs      (dev server on :4323)
 *
 * This runs a WHOLE interview for a throwaway candidate on a reserved
 * test domain - register, apply, plan the session, answer every question,
 * finish - and then asks what actually went out. It asserts on the
 * PROVIDER's answer, not on an HTTP 200: "the request was accepted" and
 * "the candidate received an email" are different claims and only the
 * second one matters here.
 *
 * The candidate is removed again at the end, through the one route that
 * can do it - an admin deleting somebody whose address is on a domain
 * reserved for testing (RFC 2606) - so a run leaves nothing behind in a
 * live portal.
