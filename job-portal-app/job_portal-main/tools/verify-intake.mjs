/**
 * Naukri email -> candidate -> application -> registration email.
 *
 * The acceptance test the spec asks for, run for real: a Naukri
 * application email arrives in a recruiter's connected mailbox and, with
 * nobody typing anything, a candidate exists, an application exists with
 * its own TL-APP reference, a portal account exists with a password the
 * recruiter never sees, and the candidate has been emailed.
 *
 * The awkward cases matter more than the happy one, so most of this is
 * about them: the same email arriving twice, a second role for the same
 * person, an email with no role, an email with no address, and an
 * invoice that must not become a candidate.
