/**
 * External jobs work, and TeamLink did not move.
 *
 *     EXTERNAL_JOBS_ENABLED=true npm run dev      (in one terminal)
 *     node tools/verify-external-jobs.mjs
 *
 * The external-job layer's whole claim is that it cannot disturb the
 * existing product. A claim like that is worth nothing unless something
 * checks it, so this takes a FULL FINGERPRINT of every TeamLink job,
 * application and ATS stage before doing anything, exercises the external
 * feature end to end against real data, and then compares the fingerprint
 * field by field.
 *
 * It creates one source, one external job, one match and one external
 * application - and deletes all four at the end, so it leaves no demo
 * data behind. Deleting the source cascades the rest; the cascade runs
 * away from TeamLink and cannot reach a candidate.
 *
 * Nothing in this file sends an email, an SMS or a call. The external
 * layer has no notification path at all, which is itself asserted below.
