/**
 * The nearby places are listed ONCE, never twice.
 *
 *     node tools/verify-nearby-once.mjs      (needs the dev server on :4323)
 *
 * Two different parts of the location filter drew the same list: the
 * picker panel drew it in a NEARBY PLACES section, and a strip under the
 * field drew the same towns again as another row of things to tick. So
 * "19 near Tirupati" appeared twice on screen, one above the other, same
 * towns, same distances, both selectable.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SEPARATE NEARBY SECTION AT ALL NOW. The radius filters the
 * one location list and draws each distance on the row it belongs to, so
 * counting "how many nearby lists are visible" no longer asks anything -
 * the answer is zero however broken the screen is.
 *
 * What this asks instead is the question the complaint was actually
 * about: does any PLACE appear more than once in the panel? That holds
 * whatever the list is made of, and it fails the moment anything starts
 * drawing the same town twice again.
