# TeamLink Job Portal

The TeamLink prototype, backed by a real PostgreSQL database, API and
authentication — with the frontend left exactly as it was.

## The one rule

`baseline/prototype.html` is the visual source of truth and is **never
edited**. `web/build.mjs` verifies its SHA-256 before every build and
refuses to run if it has changed.

The shipped application is that file plus **one appended `<script>` tag**
(442 bytes). No CSS rule, HTML template or render function was modified.

```
npm run ui:compare baseline integrated     →  76/80 screens identical
```

The four that differ are deliberate and documented in
[docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md) — both are security fixes, not
design changes.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm --prefix api install
node web/build.mjs

# first run: load the prototype's demo content
LOAD_SEED=true node tools/dev-server.mjs 4323

# after that
node tools/dev-server.mjs 4323
```

Open **http://localhost:4323**. Data is written to `var/dev-db` and
survives restarts.

> **Open it from the server, not from the file.** Double-clicking
> `web/index.html` runs the page on `file://`, where it has no origin to
> call: `fetch('/api/bootstrap')` becomes `file:///C:/api/bootstrap`, the
> browser refuses the scheme, and the app loads with no data at all. It
> will tell you so rather than blaming your connection — but the address
> bar has to say `http://localhost:4323`.

### One file, served from anywhere

`TeamLink_JobPortal_Backend_Integrated.html` is the whole frontend in a
single file - the prototype byte for byte, with the integration layer and
the demo fixtures inlined instead of linked.

```bash
npm run export:single                    # rebuild it
npm run export:single -- --api-port 8080 # if the API is elsewhere
```

It still needs the API running: the file is the interface, not the
database. Start `npm run dev`, then serve the file from any static server
**on the same hostname**:

```bash
python -m http.server 5183      # then open http://localhost:5183/
```

The port may differ; the hostname may not. Session cookies are
SameSite=Lax, so `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` count as different sites and
a session opened on one is not sent to the other. To point the file at a
different API without rebuilding, add `?api=` to the URL:

```
http://localhost:5183/?api=https://jobs.example.com/api
```

Outside production the API accepts any loopback origin so this works
without configuration. In production the allowlist is `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`
plus `EXTRA_ORIGINS`, and nothing else.

### Against a real PostgreSQL server

Set `DATABASE_URL` and the same command uses it instead — identical stack
to production, and local and live can share one database:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://app_api:pw@host:5432/teamlink \
ADMIN_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:pw@host:5432/teamlink \
node tools/dev-server.mjs 4323
```

## Is it actually connected?

```bash
npm run verify:stack          # 14 checks: CRUD, auth, RLS, no hardcoded URLs

npm run verify:stack -- --write
# restart the server
npm run verify:stack -- --check     # did the record survive?
```

A UI that shows a record it just created proves nothing. These re-read
from the database.

From the browser, open the console on any page and run:

```js
TL.diagnose()
```

It answers in one line — `CONNECTED`, `NOT CONNECTED`, `NOT SERVED` or
`BROWSER OFFLINE` — and prints the last five failed calls with their
method, URL, status and response. On localhost every API failure is
already logged that way as it happens; add `?tlDebug=1` to the URL to get
the same logging anywhere else.

There is also a visual version at **/status.html**, and the full candidate
journey can be driven end to end with:

```bash
npm run verify:candidate      # register -> login -> apply -> history -> refresh
```

## Architecture

```
browser (the prototype, unchanged)
   │  fetch /api/…          relative — follows whatever domain serves it
   ▼
Express API                 sessions, CSRF, validation, rate limiting
   │  connects as app_api    unprivileged; the server refuses to start otherwise
   ▼
PostgreSQL                  row-level security on every table
```

`DATA` stays a synchronous in-memory cache filled once from
`/api/bootstrap`, so all ~700 synchronous call sites in the 22,935-line
prototype keep working untouched. See
[docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md).

## Verification

```bash
npm run verify:db         # schema 10 · RLS 29 · seed 16 · migrations 13
npm run test:api          # 72 end-to-end tests against real PostgreSQL
npm run verify:stack      # 14 live checks
npm run verify:candidate  # the candidate journey, plus every way a call can fail
npm run verify:interaction # clicks real buttons
npm run verify:search     # proves search runs in SQL
npm run rehearse          # a whole deployment against an empty database
```

Nothing is mocked. The API tests run against PostgreSQL over the wire with
RLS active, as an unprivileged role.

## Deploying

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # then fill it in
docker compose up -d
```

Full runbook: [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

The schema has **no Supabase-specific dependencies** — it needs
PostgreSQL 13+ and optionally `pg_trgm` — so it runs on your own box or on
Supabase Cloud by changing one variable.

## A note on the prototype

`baseline/prototype.html` carries a Supabase **publishable** key and
project reference from an earlier integration. Publishable keys are
designed to sit in browser code and are protected by row-level security,
not by secrecy — but they are visible in this repository. That path is
disabled at runtime (`docs/INTEGRATION.md`, §15), because the application
API is the single source of truth.
