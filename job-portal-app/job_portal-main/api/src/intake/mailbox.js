 *            TeamLink one. A minimal client: LOGIN, SELECT, SEARCH,
 *            FETCH, STORE. No dependency, because the alternative is a
 *            large tree for five commands.
 *   gmail    the REST API with an OAuth access token.
 *   outlook  Microsoft Graph, same shape.
 *
 * Credentials NEVER come from the database or the browser. They are read
 * from the environment, per mailbox address, so a compromised recruiter
 * session cannot exfiltrate them and the UI has no field to leak.
