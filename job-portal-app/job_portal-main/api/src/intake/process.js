/**
 * Naukri email in, candidate out - and everything that follows from it.
 *
 *   message
 *     -> is this an application at all?
 *     -> extract what is actually there
 *     -> is this person already in the database?  (email, then mobile)
 *     -> create or UPDATE the candidate, never fork them
 *     -> which requirement?  no confident answer -> the recruiter's queue
 *     -> create the application, which gets TL-APP-2026-00452
 *     -> create the portal account with a password nobody types
 *     -> email, SMS and WhatsApp, all quoting the same reference
 *     -> write the timeline
 *
 * Rules that hold throughout:
 *
 *   - the same message is processed once. `email_messages` has a unique
 *     (mailbox, message_id) and every sync records what it saw BEFORE it
 *     decides anything.
 *   - one person, many applications. A second Naukri email for a
 *     different role adds an application to the same candidate.
 *   - nothing is invented. A field absent from the email stays empty and
 *     the candidate fills it in on the portal.
 *   - a failed message never stops the sync, and a failed SMS never
 *     undoes a created candidate.

/**
 * The outcomes a second attempt is allowed to revisit.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The sync records every message before it decides
 * anything, and a message it has already decided on is skipped forever -
 * which is right for a candidate who was imported and wrong for one it
 * could not read. Seventeen real Shine responses sat at
 * `needs_review` saying "No candidate name could be read from this
 * email", and when the parser that could read them was written there was
 * no way to point it at them: the sync saw them, said "already
 * processed", and moved on. The fix for the parser fixed nothing.
 *
 * WHY ONLY THESE THREE. Every one of them is a dead end where NOTHING
 * was created - all three `needs_review` returns happen before the
 * candidate row, `ignored` never gets that far, and `failed` threw.
 * There is nothing to duplicate by trying again.
 *
 * `needs_mapping` IS HERE NOW, and it was not before. The reasoning for
 * leaving it out was that it is "waiting on a recruiter's decision" - but
 * a message at needs_mapping has a candidate and NO application, and the
 * decision it waits on is which requirement to attach it to. Since the
 * intake can now create that requirement when a board names a role
 * nobody has posted, reconsidering these is the whole point: fifteen
 * Shine candidates sat there behind a requirement called "Radiologist"
 * that did not exist.
 *
 * Re-running one cannot fork a person: the candidate is found again by
 * email or mobile and updated, never created twice. It cannot duplicate
 * an application either - there is none yet, and the application insert
 * below checks for an existing one first.
 *
 * `duplicate` IS HERE TOO, for one reason: the resume. A message whose
 * application already exists used to stop before the attachment was
 * stored, so a CV could never catch up with a candidate imported before
 * it could be read - or before the format was accepted at all, which is
 * what kept a photographed CV out. Re-running one creates nothing: the
 * application is found, reported as a duplicate exactly as before, and
 * the only new thing that can happen is a resume filling an empty slot.
 *
 * `processed` and `updated` stay out. Those finished, and re-running
 * them would send the candidate their welcome message a second time.
