/**
 * Naukri email in, candidate out - and everything that follows from it.
 *
 *   message
 *     -> is this an application at all?
 *     -> extract what is actually there
 *     -> is this person already in the database?  (email, then mobile)
 *     -> create or UPDATE the candidate, never fork them
 *     -> which requirement?  no confident answer -> the recruiter's queue
 *     -> create the application, which gets TL-APP-2026-00452
 *     -> create the portal account with a password nobody types
 *     -> email, SMS and WhatsApp, all quoting the same reference
 *     -> write the timeline
 *
 * Rules that hold throughout:
 *
 *   - the same message is processed once. `email_messages` has a unique
 *     (mailbox, message_id) and every sync records what it saw BEFORE it
 *     decides anything.
 *   - one person, many applications. A second Naukri email for a
 *     different role adds an application to the same candidate.
 *   - nothing is invented. A field absent from the email stays empty and
 *     the candidate fills it in on the portal.
 *   - a failed message never stops the sync, and a failed SMS never
 *     undoes a created candidate.
