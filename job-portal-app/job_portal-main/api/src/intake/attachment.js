/**
 * The resume that came attached to the email.
 *
 * The intake screen has always shown "Priya_Sharma.pdf" beside an
 * imported candidate, and the file was nowhere: `bodyOf` read the
 * attachment's NAME out of the MIME headers and nothing ever read the
 * bytes. So a candidate imported from a mailbox had a resume in the
 * sense that somebody could see it had existed, and none of the things a
 * resume is for - no text to search, nothing for the screening to read,
 * nothing to send a client, and a Download button with no file behind
 * it.
 *
 * This stores it, through exactly the path an uploaded resume takes:
 *
 *   validateResume   magic bytes, not the sender's word for the type
 *   storeResume      object storage, content-addressed key
 *   extractResumeText + extractFields   the same parser
 *   applyExtractedFields                into empty columns only
 *
 * THE FILENAME IS NOT TRUSTED. An email attachment is as
 * attacker-controlled as a browser upload - more so, since anybody can
 * send one - and calling something .pdf does not make it a PDF. The
 * validator reads the first bytes and refuses anything that is not
 * genuinely a document, which is what stops a mailbox becoming a way to
 * put an executable, or an HTML file, into storage.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO is overwrite a resume that is already on file. The
 * candidate's own upload is the one they chose; a digest arriving three
 * weeks later must not silently replace it. The file is recorded as seen
 * and skipped, with the reason, so a recruiter can decide.
