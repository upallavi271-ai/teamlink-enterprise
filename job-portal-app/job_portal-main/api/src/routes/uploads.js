/**
 * Resume upload and download (requirements 8, 9, 19).

 * The prototype's Upload Resume -> AI Extraction -> Review flow keeps its

 * storage instead of a base64 string in localStorage, and the candidate
 * record keeps a reference.
 *
 * Requirement 9 matters here — if extraction cannot fill a field, the
 * candidate is still saved with whatever was parsed and the field stays
 * editable. Nothing is discarded because a parse was incomplete.
