/**
 * GET /api/bootstrap — the hydrate payload.
 *
 * THIS IS THE KEYSTONE OF THE WHOLE INTEGRATION.
 *
 * The prototype reads data synchronously, inline, inside template
 * literals — `DATA.jobById(id)` alone appears 163 times. Turning those
 * into awaits would mean rewriting all 19 page renderers and most of the
 * 691 functions, which is the rebuild the requirements forbid.
 *
 * So `DATA` stays a synchronous in-memory cache. This endpoint fills it
 * once, before the first render, and every existing call site keeps
 * working untouched. Mutations go out through the write endpoints and
 * update the same cache.
 *
 * What comes back is scoped by RLS, so the same URL returns a candidate's
 * own slice, a recruiter's company slice, or everything for an admin —
 * without the handler containing a single `if (role === ...)`.
