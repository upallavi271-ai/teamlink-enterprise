/**
 * Telling a candidate where they stand, on demand.
 *
 * Everything here already happens by itself — an application sends its
 * confirmation, a stage move sends its update, a failed message is swept
 * up and tried again. These two endpoints exist for the cases automation
 * cannot cover:
 *
 *   send   a recruiter who wants this one person told again, now,
 *          because they rang to say they heard nothing
 *   retry  after a provider outage is fixed, without waiting out the
 *          next quarter-hour sweep
 *
 * Neither invents a message. `send` dispatches the update for the stage
 * the application is ACTUALLY at, and `retry` runs the same queue the
 * background sweep runs. A recruiter cannot compose arbitrary mail to a
 * candidate through here, and no endpoint returns a password.
