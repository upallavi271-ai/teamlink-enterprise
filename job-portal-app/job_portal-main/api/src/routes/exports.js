/* =====================================================================
   TEAMLINK — exporting candidates out of the recruiter portal
   =====================================================================

   Three things leave through here: a CSV, an .xlsx, and a ZIP of the
   actual resume files. All three are the same selection of people seen
   three ways, so they share one selection step, one permission check and
   one audit line.

   THE SELECTION IS ALWAYS A LIST OF IDS.

   The screen offers "selected", "everything matching the current
   filters" and "this page", and it resolves all three to ids BEFORE it
   calls this route - by asking the list endpoint, which already owns
   every filter the sidebar can set. Re-implementing that WHERE clause
   here would be a second copy of forty filters, and the two would
   disagree the first time one of them changed. The scope word still
   travels with the request, because the audit line should say which of
   the three the recruiter chose.

   WHAT STOPS A RECRUITER EXPORTING SOMEBODY ELSE'S POOL.

   Nothing in this file. The read runs through `withUser(req.session)`
   like every other read, so row-level security answers it: a recruiter
   sees their company's candidates and an administrator sees all of them.
   An id that is not theirs comes back as no row, and the export simply
   does not contain that person - it is not an error, because a request
   for forty ids of which one is not visible is a stale page, not an
   attack. The count in the audit line is what was actually read.

   EVERY EXPORT IS LOGGED BEFORE THE FILE IS BUILT (0084). A log written
   afterwards misses precisely the exports that went wrong.

   NOTHING IS STREAMED FROM MEMORY IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE. The list
   formats are small. The ZIP reads resumes one at a time and appends
   them to the archive rather than loading the pool first, and the
   hundred-file ceiling below keeps the worst case bounded.
