/**
 * Smart job matching.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT SHAPES ALL OF THIS: one keyword is not a match.
 *
 * A candidate with "Java" on their profile must not be messaged about
 * every job that mentions Java. That is how an alert system becomes spam,
 * and once candidates learn to ignore the alerts the whole feature is
 * worth less than nothing — it has trained the audience to delete us.
 *
 * So a match is scored across six dimensions, and two HARD GATES are
 * applied before the score is even consulted:
 *
 *   gate 1  at least half the job's named skills, and never fewer than
 *           two, must be on the candidate's profile
 *   gate 2  the candidate's experience must not be far outside the band
 *           the job asks for
 *
 * A profile that passes both is then scored out of 100:
 *
 *   skills        50   how much of what the job asks for they actually have
 *   experience    15   inside the band, or just outside it
 *   role          15   their title or preferred role against the job title
 *   location      10   their location or preferred location, remote counts
 *   education      5   the qualification the job asks for
 *   preferences    5   expected salary, notice period, work mode
 *
 * and then SKILL COVERAGE CAPS THE RESULT: a candidate with none of the
 * skills the requirement names cannot score above 20 however well the
 * other five dimensions read. Without that cap the score was mostly a
 * measure of being in the right city with a plausible number of years,
 * and a microbiologist sat at 58% against Human Resource Recruiter.
 *
 * Only those above the configured threshold are notified.
 *
 * Every number the engine produces comes with the evidence for it, because
 * a recruiter looking at "78%" needs to see WHICH skills matched before
 * they trust it, and a candidate who asks why they were contacted deserves
 * an answer better than "the algorithm".

 * A candidate in the right city, with plausible years behind them and a
 * degree, banked around fifty before the first skill was looked at - so
 * a microbiologist scored 58% against Human Resource Recruiter while
 * matching none of the ten skills that requirement names, and a Java
 * intern scored 58% against the same role. Sorting by match score put
