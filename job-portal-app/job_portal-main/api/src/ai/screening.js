/**
 * AI screening, for everybody who applies.
 *
 * Screening was a button: a recruiter opened an application, pressed "Run
 * AI Screening", and a moment later it moved. That works for ten
 * applications a week and fails for a hundred a day - the ones nobody
 * pressed the button on simply sat there, unscored, indistinguishable
 * from the ones that had been looked at and rejected.
 *
 * Every application is now screened the moment it exists, whichever way
 * it arrived: the portal, Easy Apply, a Naukri email, an import. The
 * recruiter's decision is what to DO with the score, not whether to
 * produce one.
 *
 * THE SCORE IS THE ADMIN'S, NOT MINE
 *
 * `app_settings.ai` already carries weights - skills 45, experience 30,
 * education 15, location 10 - and an auto-shortlist threshold of 80.
 * Those were settings with nothing reading them. The score is computed
 * with exactly those numbers, so changing them in AI Settings changes
 * what the pipeline does, which is what a setting is for.
 *
 * The evidence comes from the same matcher the job alerts use, so "78%"
 * means the same thing on an alert and on an application.
