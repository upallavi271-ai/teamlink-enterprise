/**
 * What each candidate email actually says.
 *
 * The wording lived inside the template builder, one ad-hoc paragraph
 * per event, and every message read slightly differently - "Hi" in one,
 * "Hello" in another, a details block in some and not in others. A
 * candidate receiving four of them across a hiring process could not
 * tell they came from the same company.
 *
 * This is the house format, in one place:
 *
 *     Dear <name>,
 *     <the message>
 *     <details block>
 *     <what to do next>
 *     [ one button ]
 *     If you have any questions, please contact our recruitment team.
 *     Regards,
 *     TeamLink Consultants - Recruitment Team
 *
 * Each entry gives the subject, the opening, the facts worth listing and
 * the action. The shell around it is notify/layout.js; the plain-text
 * alternative is composed from the same pieces, so the two cannot drift
 * apart the way separately-written copies do.
 *
 * A FACT WITH NO VALUE IS DROPPED, never printed as a label with a blank
 * or the word "undefined" beside it - an email that says
 * "Location:" and nothing else reads as broken software.
