/**
 * The candidate-facing messages an application sends when it is made:
 * the interview invitation (email, SMS, WhatsApp, IVR, Naukri), the
 * "Application received" confirmation when the invitation did not go out,
 * and the AI interview invitation that starts the two-day clock.
 *
 * Moved here unchanged from POST /api/applications so the same code runs
 * either straight away (every ordinary apply) or when a one-click
 * application's Undo window has passed (notify/apply-hold.js, 0104).
 *
 * Never throws: every step keeps its own try/catch, as it did in the route.
