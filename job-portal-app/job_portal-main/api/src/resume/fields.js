/**
 * Structured candidate details, read out of resume text.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, PLAINLY
 * ---------------------
 * This is a deterministic parser, not a language model. It finds a value
 * only where the resume actually states one, and returns nothing for the
 * rest. That distinction is the point: a field left empty here means "the
 * resume did not say", which the form then leaves for the candidate to
 * fill. Nothing is guessed, defaulted or borrowed from a sample.
 *
 * When AI_API_KEY is configured, ai.js sends the same text to a model and
 * that result is preferred — but its output is run through the same
 * validation below, because a model will cheerfully return a plausible
 * phone number that is not in the document.
 *
 * Every value returned carries the span of text it came from, so the
 * caller can show the candidate WHY a field was filled in.

   * all beside a resume that lists twenty, which is exactly what a
