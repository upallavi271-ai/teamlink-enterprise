/**
 * Database access.
 *
 * Every application query runs inside `withUser`, which opens a
 * transaction and binds the caller's identity to it:
 *
 *     set_config('app.user_id', <uuid>, true)   -- `true` = transaction-local
 *     set_config('app.role',    <role>, true)
 *
 * The policies in 0002_rls.sql read those two settings. Because the pool
 * connects as the unprivileged `app_api` role, the database re-checks every
 * row against them — so a missing permission check in a route handler
 * cannot leak another tenant's data. That is the point of requirement 5's
 * "not only frontend hiding".
 *
 * The settings are transaction-LOCAL, so a pooled connection handed to the
 * next request never carries the previous caller's identity.
