# Frontend integration — what changed, and what didn't

## The prototype is untouched

`baseline/prototype.html` is byte-identical to the file supplied:

```
SHA-256  8cc4b430d496694618d72a51ce0a7cd11fe567701d3544ac852d38186efc0862
```

`web/build.mjs` asserts that hash before every build and refuses to run if
it has moved. The served app is the prototype **plus one appended
`<script>` tag** — 442 bytes, 7 lines. The first 1,587,110 bytes of
`web/index.html` are verified byte-for-byte identical to the input.

No CSS rule, no HTML template, no render function was edited.

## How the data source was swapped without touching the UI

The prototype reads data synchronously inside template literals —
`DATA.jobById(id)` alone appears 163 times. Making those `await` would
mean rewriting all 19 page renderers.

So `DATA` stays a synchronous in-memory cache. Only its edges moved:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| boot | seed arrays in the file | one `await /api/bootstrap` before first paint |
| reads | `DATA.jobById(id)` | **unchanged** — all ~700 call sites still work |
| writes | mutate the array | intercepted → API → reconcile → `render()` |
| storage | 58 `localStorage` keys | shimmed: same `get/set`, backed by `/api/prefs` |

Two interception seams are used, both of which the prototype already uses
on itself: function wrapping (`const prev = window.fn`) and `localStorage`
(every persistence path funnels through a known key — `persistPosting()`
writes job creates *and* edits through `teamlink_posted_jobs_v1`).

## UI fidelity result

```
npm run ui:compare baseline integrated

  identical: 76/80   layout: 4   styling: 2   data-only: 0
  console errors: 0
```

80 screens = 40 routes × desktop 1440 and mobile 390.

Capture against a freshly started `tools/dev-server.mjs`. Running the other
verification suites first leaves interviews and applications in the dev
database, and the comparison then reports those extra rows as differences.

**Four screens differ, in two groups. Both are required by the security
requirements, and neither is a design change.**

---

### 1. `login-candidate` — the "Quick demo login" panel is empty

The prototype built that panel from `DATA.candidates` directly
(`demoAccountsFor`, prototype.html:2199), which meant an anonymous visitor
to `#/login/candidate` was shown **four real candidates' names and email
addresses** on an unauthenticated page.

Every button in that panel also called `loginAs(role, id)` — a **one-click
passwordless sign-in**. Keeping it working would defeat the entire
authentication system; it is the same hole as `submitLogin()` accepting any
candidate.

What was done:

- Staff accounts (recruiter, client, admin) still populate the panel, from
  `public_login_hints()` — a single narrow `SECURITY DEFINER` function, so
  the disclosure is explicit and auditable in one place.
- **Candidates are never listed.** They are members of the public.
- Clicking a name focuses the email field and names the person. It does not
  fill in an address (only one staff email is already printed on that page;
  auto-filling the rest would publish addresses that are not otherwise
  public) and it does not sign anyone in.
- `SHOW_LOGIN_HINTS=false` removes the panel's contents entirely for a real
  production deployment.

**This is the one screen where the UI could not be preserved exactly and
also meet the security requirements.** The markup and styling are
unchanged; the candidate panel simply has no rows.

### 2. `client-candidates` — cross-company candidates no longer appear

A TechNova client (`c1`, Rajeev Menon) was shown **Rohit Malhotra**, whose
application is to `j2` — an **InnovateSoft** job. Also Vikram Singh and
Sneha Kulkarni, likewise from other companies.

That is a cross-tenant leak: one client company could see another's
candidate pipeline. The row count drops from 10 to 3 because the client now
sees only their own company's candidates, at client-visible stages only.

The design is identical — same table, same badges, same styling. There are
fewer rows because there should always have been fewer rows.

---

## Also fixed while integrating

| Found | Consequence | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `previousCompanies` stored as `text`, but the prototype uses an **array** | `(c.previousCompanies \|\| []).join` threw on the candidate profile | column is `text[]`; a test now asserts **all seven** array-valued candidate fields stay arrays |
| The seed extractor read only the `DATA` block | prototype.html:6392 enriches candidates with gender, `emailVerified`, `mobileVerified` and recruiter notes — **all silently lost**, while every row count still looked right | the extractor now reads the **fully loaded page**; 8/10 verification flags and 4 recruiter notes recovered, with a regression guard |
| CSP blocked `cdn.jsdelivr.net` | EmailJS SDK failed to load, breaking email notifications | that one origin allowed explicitly |
| The two public demo screens crashed | `/ai-pipeline` and `/whatsapp-demo` dereference `cand5`/`cand4`, which RLS correctly hides from anonymous visitors | demo fixtures in a static file, swapped in **only during a demo-screen render**; never database rows, never in Find Candidates or any dashboard total |

## Find Candidates and interview scheduling

Both were still going through the in-memory cache. They now use the API.

### Find Candidates — filtering moved into SQL (requirements 10, 11)

The screen already exposed the seams needed, so nothing about it changed:

| Seam | Used for |
|---|---|
| `window.getFilteredCandidates(pool)` | the documented pool hook `baseResults()` calls (`:6502`) |
| `window.fcrSet` / `fcrToggleFacet` | every filter change |
| `window.fcrSetPage` / `fcrSetPageSize` | paging |

Filters now reach Postgres as query parameters: keywords, skills, location,
notice period, education, industry, experience range, salary range, gender,
verification flags, resume presence, recruiter-comment tag, and activity
window. The existing client chain — five stacked layers of criteria filters
(`:9768`, `:10400`, `:10672`, `:13413`) plus the local "hide viewed / hide
emailed" refinements — still runs, but on the server's result window rather
than the whole candidate table.

**One honest limitation.** The screen pages through results in the browser
(`paged()` at `:6752` slices `list.length`), so the client is handed a
bounded *window* of matches — 200 by default, `TL.fcr.window` — rather than
one page at a time. Filtering genuinely happens in SQL and the browser never
receives the whole table, which is what requirement 11 is protecting
against. Fetching strictly one page per request would mean rewriting
`paged()`, which is inside the screen's own IIFE — a UI change. Say the word
if you want that trade made the other way.

### Interview scheduling

`mjScheduleInterview()` pushed straight into `DATA.interviews`, so a
scheduled interview existed only in that browser tab. It now creates a real
row, and the API moves the application to `interview_scheduled` and notifies
the candidate **in the same transaction**, so the three can never disagree.

A selected or rejected candidate is not demoted back to
`interview_scheduled` — scheduling a follow-up round no longer rewinds their
stage.

## Three more defects found while wiring this

| Found | Consequence | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `date` columns round-tripped through a JS `Date` | node-postgres parses `date` at **local** midnight, so any server east of UTC rendered it a day early — book the 15th, display the 14th | a type parser keeps `date` a plain `YYYY-MM-DD` string; a test asserts the round trip |
| `interviews_write` and `offers_write` checked the ROLE but not the COMPANY | any recruiter could schedule an interview against another company's job and candidate — and the read policy then hid it from them, which is worse | both policies now name the caller's company; an RLS test covers it |
| The UI suite captured `recruiter/find`, which does not exist | it rendered blank in **both** builds, so it compared as "identical" and the real screen was never checked at all | route corrected to `find-candidates`; the capture now warns about any screen that renders almost nothing |

That last one is the instructive failure: a comparison harness reports
"no change" just as happily when it is looking at nothing.

## Two things only found by actually clicking

### The CSP killed every button in the application

`helmet` defaults `script-src-attr` to `'none'`, which blocks inline event
handler **attributes** — `onclick=`, `onsubmit=`, `onchange=` — completely
independently of `script-src 'unsafe-inline'`.

The prototype has **1,034 of them**:

```
onclick 807 · onchange 132 · oninput 57 · onkeydown 9 · onsubmit 5 · onfocus 3 · onblur 3
```

Every one was dead. The login form fell back to a native GET, which put the
password in the address bar:

```
?email=recruiter%40teamlink.com&password=TeamLink%402026
```

Nothing caught it. The pages rendered identically, the UI comparison
reported 76/80, there were zero console errors, and all 114 other checks
passed — because every one of them drove the app through its JavaScript API
rather than its controls.

Fixed with `scriptSrcAttr: ["'unsafe-inline'"]`, and
`tools/verify-interaction.mjs` now clicks real buttons so it cannot recur.

### The prototype already talked to a different Supabase project

`TL_SUPA` / `TL_API` (`:21156`) points at project `ohamvhilaljvkjpzaaln` and
fetches jobs straight from the browser.

The key there is a **publishable** one and the code explicitly refuses
`service_role` keys, so this was never a credential leak. But it is a second
source of truth for jobs against a different database — which requirement 17
rules out — and it is the browser querying a database directly, which
requirement 2 rules out.

`TL_API.configured()` gates on `TL_SUPA.url` and falls back to reading
`DATA`, which this file fills from the real API. Clearing that url is
therefore the whole fix: every `TL_API` call keeps working and resolves
against the backend instead. The original values are kept on
`TL.disabledSupabase` for reference.

## Behaviour that deliberately changed

These are required by the security requirements and cannot be preserved:

- `loginAs()` no longer mints a session. The server decides who you are.
- `submitLogin()` no longer accepts any candidate without a password.
- `ROLE_CREDENTIALS` (`Admin@123` et al.) is dead — the login form posts to
  `/api/auth/login` and the constant is never read.
- A recruiter sees their own company's pipeline. An admin still sees
  everything.

## The offline message that was never about being offline

A reported bug: logging in or clicking **Apply Now** showed

> You appear to be offline - check your connection

three or four times over, on a machine with a working connection.

The message was produced by this file. Every `fetch` rejection mapped to
one code, `NETWORK`, and that one string. A rejection means *no response
at all*, which has four quite different causes, and only one of them is
being offline:

| What happened | `navigator.onLine` | What the app said | What it says now |
|---|---|---|---|
| Page opened from disk (`file://`) | `true` | you are offline | this page was opened as a file |
| API not running | `true` | you are offline | cannot reach the TeamLink server |
| Request timed out | `true` | you are offline | the server took too long |
| Machine really offline | `false` | you are offline | you appear to be offline |

The actual fault was the first row. `web/index.html` opened by
double-clicking it has no http origin, so `fetch('/api/bootstrap')`
resolves to `file:///C:/api/bootstrap` and Chrome refuses the scheme
before any request leaves the browser. Nothing loads - `DATA.jobs` is 0 -
and the app blamed the network. The repetition was one toast per failed
call: bootstrap, then login, then apply.

What changed, all in `web/teamlink-integration.js`:

- **Classification.** `classify()` picks the code from the conditions, and
  the offline wording is reachable only when `navigator.onLine === false`.
- **No server to call.** A `file://` page fails the request immediately,
  with an explanation and a console message naming the fix, instead of
  attempting a fetch that cannot succeed.
- **Timeouts.** Requests abort after 20s (`opts.timeout` to override) so a
  hung server surfaces as a timeout, not a button stuck on "Signing in...".
- **Status mapping.** A response without one of the API's own error codes -
  a proxy's 502, a bare 404 - is mapped from its HTTP status: 401/403
  authentication, 404 not found, 409 conflict, 422 validation, 500 server,
  502/503 unreachable, 504 timeout.
- **One failure, one toast.** An identical message inside the toast's own
  4.2s lifetime is the same event reported twice, and is suppressed.
- **`TL.diagnose()`** in the console answers "is the backend connected?"
  with a verdict, the API base, and the last five failed calls. On
  localhost every failure is already logged with its method, URL, status
  and response body; `?tlDebug=1` turns that on anywhere.

### Four defects underneath it

Chasing this turned up faults that had nothing to do with the toast.

1. **`GET /api/bootstrap` fired 13 queries with `Promise.all` on one
   connection.** They share a client, so node-postgres queues them anyway -
   there was no concurrency to win. What it did add: when one query failed,
   the transaction aborted and the twelve still queued returned 25P02
   "current transaction is aborted". `Promise.all` then rejected with
   whichever landed first, so the log named a symptom and the original
   error was lost. Now sequential.

2. **A stage note could not be saved.** The API wrote it with
   `update application_stage_history set note=$1 ... order by id desc limit 1`,
   which is MySQL syntax; PostgreSQL rejects it outright. The failed
   statement aborted the transaction, so the rest of the move failed with
   25P02 and returned `DATABASE_ERROR`. It was wrapped in `.catch(() => {})`
   commented "history is advisory; never fail the move over it" - the catch
   is precisely what made the move impossible. Every existing test moved a
   stage *without* a note, so 70 tests passed over it. The note now travels
   with the move through `app.stage_note`, written by the trigger that
   already inserts the history row (migration `0008_stage_note.sql`).

3. **A poisoned connection went back into the pool.** If the rollback in
   `withUser` also failed, the client was released still inside the aborted
   transaction, and the *next* request failed with 25P02 somewhere
   unrelated - which is why login and bootstrap were failing for no reason
   of their own. Such a connection is now destroyed, not reused.

4. **A fresh checkout came up with the wrong origin.** `api/src/config.js`
   reads `process.env` once at import time. `tools/dev-server.mjs` set its
   defaults *after* the seeding step - and seeding imports `auth.js`, which
   imports `config.js`, on a first run only. So run one had
   `PUBLIC_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080` and rejected every POST from the
   browser with `403 Origin not allowed`, while curl worked (it sends no
   Origin header) and a restart "fixed" it. The defaults now precede every
   `api/src` import.

Also fixed: a 401 from any background call used to sign the candidate out
mid-application. `/auth/me` is now consulted first, and only a session the
server agrees is gone ends the session. And `localStorage.removeItem` sent
`DELETE /api/prefs/<key>` for keys the database owns, which 401'd after
logout; it now mirrors the guards `setItem` already had.

## The AI calling agent

Find Candidates already had a 📞 IVR button. Behind it was a
press-1-for-yes phone menu, POSTed **from the browser** to whatever URL a
recruiter had typed into a settings box and kept in `localStorage`. Three
things were wrong with that, and only one of them was the phone menu: the
endpoint was configured per browser so no two recruiters agreed on it, and
the call never touched this application — no record, no RBAC check, no
do-not-contact check, no ATS update.

The same button now holds a conversation.

### The thing that makes it not an IVR

Before dialling, `plan()` reads the candidate record that already exists
and works out what it must NOT ask. Asking somebody whose resume is open
in front of you for their name is the fastest way to be hung up on, so the
name, the current company, the designation, the experience, the education,
the location and the skills are all marked *known* — stated at most, never
asked. What is left is what the call is for:

| asked | only when |
|---|---|
| a required skill | the resume does not evidence it |
| location | the job's city differs from theirs, and the role is not remote |
| work mode | the role is hybrid or onsite |
| expected CTC | it is missing, or the profile is more than 45 days old |
| notice period | same |

A shortlisted candidate hears "your profile has been shortlisted"; nobody
ever hears "you are selected" unless the ATS actually says so.

### Interrupts, not steps

There is no "question 3 of 7". Every candidate turn is classified first,
and an urgent intent short-circuits the machine from any state:

* **busy** → stop screening, take a callback time ("call me tomorrow
  evening after 6" is parsed in all three languages) and end
* **angry** → apologise once, offer to stop, never argue; a second angry
  turn closes the call
* **"don't call me again"** → `do_not_contact` on the candidate, and the
  queue function then refuses to dial them ever again
* **"can I speak to a recruiter"** → a recruiter callback with their
  question attached
* **silence** → "are you still there?", then "no problem", then a callback
* **bad audio** → twice politely, then hand off to a recruiter
* **wrong number** → apologise, flag the number, end

A question at any point is answered from the job record — or, if the
answer is not in the data, with "I'll have our recruiter confirm that".
There is no third branch, so the agent cannot invent a client name, a
salary or an interview date.

### Three languages, switched mid-call

Detection runs on **every** turn, not once. Script is decisive; romanised
speech is scored on function words, because "React Developer" is identical
in all three and carries no signal. A borrowed noun — "notice period",
"salary", "location" — counts towards *code switching* but not towards
*which language*, which is what makes "Haan main interested hoon but
notice period 60 days hai" come out as Hinglish rather than English.

"Telugu lo matladandi" is obeyed as an instruction, not sampled as Telugu.

### Providers

```
TelephonyProvider → STT → conversation engine → TTS → TelephonyProvider
```

`local` | `twilio` | `exotel`, chosen by `TELEPHONY_PROVIDER`. With none
configured the agent runs on the local driver: the real engine, the real
database, the real ATS update, no audio — so the whole workflow is
demonstrable and testable before anybody buys telephony minutes, and the
modal says so rather than pretending.

Webhooks verify the provider's signature (Twilio's HMAC over the public
URL and the sorted body; Exotel's shared secret). An unverified webhook is
refused and logged.

### What reaches the ATS

No new candidate or job tables. The call writes back into the records that
already exist: expected CTC, notice period and preferred language onto the
candidate; a stage note and a notification onto the application. The
application's STAGE moves only for outcomes where the rule is unambiguous,
and only forward out of a screening stage — a call must not drag somebody
back out of an interview they have already had.

`ai_call_sessions`, `ai_call_turns`, `ai_call_events`, `ai_call_campaigns`,
`ai_call_callbacks`, `ai_call_settings` and `ai_call_consents` are new;
everything else is reused.

Verified by `npm run verify:calling` (25 conversations, including every
one of the awkward ones above) and `npm run verify:calling-ui` (the
recruiter's screen, driven for real).

## Job alerts: reaching the candidates we already have

Publishing a requirement used to be silent. It appeared on the board and
waited to be found, while every candidate already in the database — the
ones acquisition was paid for — heard nothing, and the recruiter's only
option was to search the list and message people one at a time.

Publishing now scores every profile against the job and messages the ones
that fit, on email, SMS and WhatsApp.

### One keyword is not a match

This is the rule the whole feature turns on, and the reason it is not
`skills && location`. A candidate with "Java" on their profile must not
be messaged about every Java job: do that for a month and the audience
learns to delete anything from us, at which point the feature is worth
less than nothing.

`api/src/ai/match.js` applies four hard gates BEFORE the score is
consulted:

| gate | rule |
|---|---|
| skills | at least half the job's named skills, never fewer than two |
| experience | not more than two years outside the band the job asks for |
| location | the job's city, their preferred city, or a remote role |
| role | the job title has to be recognisable in their title or preferred role |

A profile that passes all four is then scored out of 100 — skills 40,
experience 20, role 15, location 15, education 5, preferences 5 — and
only those above the threshold (65 by default, `JOB_MATCH_THRESHOLD`) are
contacted.

What that rejects, from the verifier:

* a frontend developer whose profile happens to list Java — *1 of 3 skills*
* the same skills in Chennai, for an office role in Hyderabad
* a fresher, for a 3–5 year role; and twelve years, for the same role
* a DevOps engineer with Java, Spring Boot and SQL — a different kind of
  role, however well the keywords line up

What it accepts: 5.5 years against a 3–5 band (a judgement a recruiter
would make), a Chennai candidate for a REMOTE role, and `Spring-Boot`
written where the job said `SpringBoot`.

### Every decision is recorded, including the ones to stay silent

`job_matches` holds a row for every candidate scored — not just the ones
contacted — because "why was this person not told about this job" is a
question the ATS has to be able to answer, and it cannot answer it from
rows that were never written. Each row carries the score, the threshold
it was judged against, the skills that matched, a per-dimension
breakdown, and a reason in plain words.

`job_match_deliveries` holds one row per channel attempt, and a trigger
rolls the latest outcome up into the three status columns the ATS grid
shows. `notified` means a message actually left — not that we tried —
so an unconfigured channel cannot make the report claim contacts that
never happened.

### The loop closes

The alert links straight to the job, carrying the match id:

```
https://.../?alert=jm_abc123#/job/j_xyz
```

Opening it records the click before the candidate has logged in, because
that is when they follow a link from their email. Applying records the
application against the match, and the source is kept as `job_alert`
rather than folded into "TeamLink Portal" — otherwise the only question
that matters, *did the alerts produce applications*, cannot be answered.

The whole path, end to end:

```
requirement published -> every profile scored -> matches alerted
  -> candidate opens the job (click recorded) -> applies (source: job_alert)
  -> confirmation -> AI interview -> AI score -> recruiter review
```

### What it deliberately will not do

* alert on a draft, paused or archived job — checked at send time, not
  only at publish time;
* message the same candidate about the same job twice, even if the job is
  re-published;
* message somebody who has already applied;
* send WhatsApp to a candidate who has not opted in;
* hold up the response to "save job" — matching runs in the background, and
  a failure there never fails the publish.

Verified by `npm run verify:matching`: eleven checks on the rule itself
with profiles built to isolate each gate, and ten through HTTP against
the running server, including a real alert delivered to a real SMTP
server.

## The AI interview: a blueprint, not a shuffle

The prototype built the interview in the browser. `generateQuestions()`
took two questions from an intro pool, five from `TECH_TEMPLATES` applied
to a shuffled skill list, and three from `BEHAV_POOL`, reshuffling until
the signature differed from the last one in `localStorage`. Ten questions,
drawn at random from templates, with no access to the resume and no link
to the job beyond a skill name.

Three things follow from that, and all three matter to a recruiter:

* it cannot ask about a project on the candidate's resume;
* it cannot ask about a requirement of the job the resume does **not**
  evidence, which is the single most useful question in a screen;
* because the mix is random, two candidates for the same role are not
  comparable — which is what a score is for.

### The shape

Fixed, and the same for everyone:

```
    2 introduction  ·  5 job description  ·  5 resume  ·  3 behavioural  =  15
```

`api/src/ai/interview.js` builds four pools and assembles them in that
order. Each question records where it came from, and that source is
carried to the recruiter's view:

```
requirement: 5+ years building REST APIs at scale
gap: GraphQL required but not evidenced on the resume
resume: project "Employee Management System"
```

A section that the data cannot fill — a two-line job description, a bare
profile — is topped up from a fallback that is still about the right
thing, and says so in the source (`resume: no project named on the
resume`). It is never padded to fifteen with questions about nothing, and
it is never short: a different NUMBER of questions would make two scores
incomparable, which is the failure the blueprint exists to prevent.

### The five scores

`technical`, `behavioral` and `communication` already existed.
`jdRelevance` and `resumeRelevance` are new and are deliberately **not**
averaged together: a candidate can know the stack the job asks for and be
vague about their own project, or the reverse, and that difference is the
most useful thing the interview finds. The blueprint guarantees five
questions behind each number.

Each answer also carries a breakdown — technical relevance,
completeness, accuracy, communication, each out of ten — stored as
`ai_interview_answers.detail`.

### Two days, from the invitation

The deadline is a property of the **application**, not of the interview
row:

```sql
applications.ai_interview_due_at  default now() + interval '48 hours'
```

An interview that starts inherits it, so opening the screen on day two
does not buy two more days. This matters because the case the reminders
exist for — a candidate who never opens the interview at all — has no
interview row to hang a deadline on.

Four messages, each sent at most once, recorded in
`ai_interview_reminders` so a re-run of the sweep cannot repeat one:

| kind | when | channels |
|---|---|---|
| `invited` | the application is confirmed | email, SMS, WhatsApp, IVR |
| `reminder` | 24 hours left | all four |
| `final` | 2 hours left | all four |
| `expired` | the window closed unused | all four |

`ai_interview_due_queue()` answers what is owed right now, most urgent
first, and skips anybody who has already completed the interview.
`api/src/notify/interview-deadline.js` sweeps it every fifteen minutes
inside the API process; `ai_interview_expire_overdue()` also runs on read,
so an expired interview reports itself even if the sweep is not running.

### The screen was unreachable

Found while wiring this, and worth recording on its own.

`applyToJob` was overridden during the integration and — reasonably —
stopped calling the prototype's `__afterApply()` finalizer, which only
built a record in `localStorage`. But that record is what the entire
post-apply experience hangs off: the confirmation screen, the "AI
Interview required" notification, the due-date chip, and the **Attend AI
Interview** button. Without it a candidate applied, saw a toast, and had
no way to reach the interview at all.

The finalizer is called again, with the database's application id, and its
deadline is immediately overwritten with the server's. Two further
consequences are handled:

* `recById()` is local to the prototype's module, so `window.recById` is
  `undefined` and every guard written against it silently did nothing —
  including the one that was supposed to record the interview result.
  `TL.aiivRec()` resolves the record through `__lcRecFor`, which **is**
  exposed, and maps between the two application ids
  (`APP-2026-000123` on screen, `app_7f3k2` in the database).
* those records live in `localStorage`, so a candidate who applied on
  their phone had nothing on their laptop. `TL.ensureLocalRecords()`
  rebuilds them from the database on every refresh, inventing nothing:
  every field comes from the application, the job or the interview row.

## "She never received anything"

The complaint that found two separate faults, both of which looked fine
from the inside.

A candidate applied, was screened, was invited to her AI interview and
given her two-day deadline. Four messages. The delivery log for
`TL-APP-2026-00332` recorded all four:

```
10:22:02  email  failed  #1  HTTP 403: API access from non-browser environments is currently disabled
10:22:03  email  failed  #2  …
10:23:26  email  failed  #3  …
10:26:08  email  failed  #6  …
```

Nothing lied. Every attempt was recorded, with the provider's own reason.
The faults were what happened next, and what "success" turned out to mean.

### Fault one: nothing ever went back

A provider outage is the ordinary case — a rate limit, an expired token, a
setting somebody had not ticked yet. When the setting was fixed at 10:36,
the four refused messages stayed refused. From her side TeamLink had
simply never written, and nobody would have found out until she rang.

`failed_deliveries_pending()` (migrations 0020, 0021) answers *who never
heard from us*: the applications whose **most recent** attempt on a
channel did not get through. Built from the latest attempt rather than
from every failure, so a message that failed and was later delivered is
not chased again — the verifier holds a second pass to zero sends.

`not_configured` counts as never having heard from us too. It is an honest
record — we did not claim to send — but from the candidate's side it is
indistinguishable from silence. 89 applications here were in that state
from before any transport existed.

Three exclusions, each for a reason:

* **three attempts**, then it is not transient and a human should look
* **do-not-contact**, which now has somewhere to be set: `doNotContact`
  on `PUT /candidates/:id`, next to `whatsappOptIn`. The flag existed
  since the calling agent (0018) but nothing outside a call could record
  it, so a request made by email could not be honoured without editing
  the database by hand. Every outbound channel checks it
* **reserved domains** — `example.com`, `.test`, `.invalid`, `.local`.
  They can receive mail nowhere, so an attempt is not a retry, it is
  burnt provider quota. Seed and test rows live there and must not crowd
  out a real person

`startRetrySweep()` runs with the other background work in `createApp()`
— fifteen minutes, fifty at a time. Deliberately slow: a thousand emails
the moment a provider recovers is its own kind of failure. Its first pass
delivered the 12 messages that were outstanding.

**Not a replay.** The message sent is the one for the candidate's
**current** stage, from the same table a recruiter's manual send uses
(`EVENT_FOR_STAGE`), so the two can never disagree. A three-day-old "your
interview is scheduled" is worse than silence once the interview has
moved.

### Fault two: `sent` does not prove sent *to her*

With the transport fixed, her messages recorded `sent`. She still had
nothing.

An EmailJS template carries its **own** "To Email" field. If that field
holds a fixed address instead of `{{to_email}}`, every message goes to
that one address, the API still answers `200 OK`, and the delivery log
still records `sent`. There is no error anywhere to find.

**This cannot be detected from the API, and one attempt to do so was
wrong.** A probe was built on the assumption that a template wired to
`{{to_email}}` would refuse a send with an empty recipient. It does not.
EmailJS performs no recipient validation whatsoever at that boundary:

```
to_email omitted entirely   200 OK
to_email = ''               200 OK
to_email = '   '            200 OK
to_email = 'not an address' 200 OK
template id wrong           400 The template ID not found
```

It validates the template id and nothing about the recipient, so an
accepted probe says nothing either way. The probe was removed, and the
finding is recorded here so nobody rebuilds it.

What is checked instead splits cleanly in two.

**Our side, asserted.** `verify:retry` calls the provider for real with
`fetch` captured and inspects the actual outbound payload: `to_email`
holds the candidate's own address, two different candidates produce two
different recipients, `{{email}}` agrees with `{{to_email}}` so it cannot
matter which one a template reads, `to_name` is the person's name rather
than their address, `reply_to` is the company rather than the candidate,
and neither key nor temporary password travels as a template variable.

**The provider's side, stated.** `check:mail` reports `EMAILJS ACCEPTED`
and then says plainly what that does *not* establish — who it went to, and
whether it arrived — naming the template settings page and Email History,
which lists the recipient a send actually used. It no longer implies more
than the API can support.

### Reaching one person

`POST /notifications/applications/:id/send` (recruiter, BDE, admin) sends
that candidate the update for the stage they are **actually** at, and
echoes the address it went to — which, for "she got nothing", is usually
the answer. It cannot compose arbitrary mail: the stage chooses the
message.

`POST /notifications/retry` (admin) runs the same queue on demand, for
when an outage has just been fixed and waiting out the sweep is silly.

From a terminal:

```bash
node tools/notify-candidate.mjs sravanthimangalapalli715@gmail.com
```

It resolves the person first and refuses to guess between two similar
names, then reports the role, the stage, the message and the recipient.
It goes through the running server rather than opening its own database
connection: the embedded development engine serves one client at a time,
so a second connection is refused while the API holds it.

## Moving to SMTP, and what the move exposed

EmailJS is built to be called from a browser. Server-side it answers
`200 OK` for almost everything and reports nothing per recipient, so
"did it go?" has no answer in the log. SMTP answers with the mail
server's own accept or refusal, per address, with a message id. The code
path already existed; only the settings changed.

Three faults surfaced during the switch, all found by doing it rather
than by reading it.

### A half-set SMTP silently disabled email

`configured()` required all four of host, user, password and from
address. The send path branched on the **host alone**. So writing a host
into `.env` before the password arrives sent every message down the SMTP
branch with no credentials, where it failed — while a working EmailJS
was skipped precisely because a host was set. Half a setting is not a
preference.

`smtpReady()` is now the single test, used by `configured()` and by the
send path. `check:mail` uses it too, and reports the transport that will
**actually** be used rather than the one the host name implies.

### "due undefined"

A real invitation went out reading

> Your AI interview for Java Developer — due undefined

`AI_INTERVIEW_INVITED` states a deadline, and only the reminder sweep
ever passed one; the stage and retry paths did not, and
`String(undefined)` is a perfectly good string. The footer had the same
fault with a missing job id, and four other messages had it with a
stage name, a score, and an application reference.

`events.js` now reads the application's real `ai_interview_due_at`, and
every template omits what it was not given rather than printing the
word. `verify:retry` holds **every** message on **every** channel against
`undefined`, `NaN` and `[object Object]`, with the optional context
deliberately withheld — which is the state a caller that forgot
something actually produces.

### The retry budget locked out the people it was for

0020 stopped chasing a delivery after three attempts, reading the count
from `notification_deliveries.attempt` — which is a **lifetime** counter
for that application and channel. A candidate who has had a
confirmation, an invitation, a deadline reminder and a few stage updates
is already past three, so the moment a provider fails she is ineligible
for the retry that exists for exactly her case. The longer somebody has
been in the pipeline, the less the safety net covers them.

Found the hard way: a real send failed on `HTTP 426: Monthly request
quota exceeded`, and the queue came back empty.

0022 counts the run of consecutive failures **since the last message that
got through**. A working channel resets it, so three means three goes at
the message in front of us. She reappeared in the queue immediately.

### A note on quota

The EmailJS free tier is a few hundred sends a month, and the verifiers
send real mail. Between the sweeps and the test runs it was exhausted,
which is its own argument for SMTP: Gmail allows far more, and a refusal
arrives as a refusal rather than as an accepted message nobody receives.

## SMS, WhatsApp and calling, where the recruiter already is

Two complaints, one screen.

Email had a settings page. SMS, WhatsApp and voice did not — although all
four **already send at every stage**, from the same `dispatchEvent`, the
same templates and the same delivery log. With no credentials they record
`not_configured`, which reads like a fault rather than a setting nobody
has filled in yet. "She got no SMS" had no answer anywhere a recruiter
could reach.

And the calling agent's configuration was admin-only, so the recruiter
placing the calls could not see what the agent would say, which languages
it answers in, whether it discloses that it is an AI, or why no phone
rang.

It is a **tab on the existing Email / SMS / IVR screen** — not a new
module and not a new menu, which the brief rules out. Same tab strip,
same panels, same classes; the prototype's five tabs are untouched and
the verifier holds them to that.

### No credential field, anywhere

The usual provider-settings page has an API Key box, often with a note
saying the value is "stored locally in this demo only". That hands the
key to everybody who can open the developer tools.

This screen has no key, token or password field on it. Credentials are
environment variables on the server; the screen reports whether they are
**present** and names the ones that are **missing**, and never receives
or renders a value. Two checks hold that: no credential-shaped input
exists, and no credential-shaped value appears in the markup.

### Three faults found by building it

**A simulator reported itself as a live carrier.** The built-in
telephony driver answers `configured: true` because it is always usable —
it is what lets the whole conversation be rehearsed on screen with no
carrier account. Reading a status badge off that flag produced
*"Connected — the agent places real calls through local"* about a
candidate nobody had dialled. `telephonyStatus()` now answers two
questions separately: `configured` (usable) and `real` (a phone rings).
The screen says **Rehearsal only** until a carrier is connected.

**A retry pass on one channel re-sent every other channel.** Extending
the sweep past email looked like a one-line change. `dispatchEvent` sends
on all four channels, so four passes would have sent four copies of the
same email to somebody whose only problem was a dead SMS gateway. The
queue is per channel, so the send is now too — `ctx.channels` names the
one being retried.

**An unconfigured channel would have spent its own retry budget.** A
sweep over WhatsApp with no credentials records `not_configured` again,
and three of those in a row exhaust the budget from 0022 — so the day
somebody finally sets WhatsApp up, everybody who was waiting for it is
already excluded. A channel that cannot send is now not retried at all,
which is what keeps its queue intact.

### Read-only, and for a specific reason

The panels started with editable fields for an admin. That was dead code:
the prototype sends anybody who is not a recruiter from `/recruiter/*` to
the recruiter login, so an admin cannot open this screen at all. A Save
button nobody can reach is worse than none — it implies a way to change
these that does not exist. The settings are changed through
`PATCH /ai-calling/settings`, which is admin-only and enforced in the API
and in the database; a verifier asserts the refusal rather than trusting
the hidden button.

## An imported candidate could not see themselves

A person who arrived through the Naukri mailbox got a portal account and
a message carrying their login. A person imported from a CSV or an Excel
file got a row in `candidates` and nothing else. The recruiter could see
them; they could not see themselves, could not correct what the file said
about them, could not upload a current resume, and never heard they were
in the database at all.

The account already had a home — `candidate_portal_account()` from 0019 —
so `notify/invite.js` reuses it and sends the credentials on the same
three channels as everything else: **email, SMS and WhatsApp**. Migration
0023 adds `candidate_invites`, which could not live in
`notification_deliveries`: that table requires an application and a job,
and an invitation has neither. It is about the person, not a role they
have applied for.

**The password lives for the length of one function call.** Generated,
hashed into `users`, put into the outgoing message, returned to nobody. It
is not logged, not stored, and appears in no API response — the record
keeps `had_credentials`, a boolean, and never the value. Two checks hold
that.

Three decisions worth stating:

* **Updated rows are invited too**, not only new ones. Somebody already in
  the database who has never had a login is in exactly the position this
  fixes.
* **The invitations are sent after the response, and not awaited.** A
  provider timing out must not roll back an import that has already
  succeeded, and a recruiter who has uploaded four hundred rows should
  not watch a spinner while four hundred messages go out.
* **Nobody is written to twice.** The first guard asked "has a message
  been SENT?" — which, on a deployment where SMS is not configured and
  email is refusing, is never true, so a second upload of the same file
  messaged everybody again. 0024 asks instead: once one got through,
  never again; otherwise not again within a day. A repeated upload is
  silent, while a genuine outage does not silence somebody forever.

### The first thing a person sees

**The resume comes first.** It was section 3 of 5, below Personal and
Professional Information — so the form asked for name, mobile, location,
company, designation, experience, qualification and skills, and only then
offered to read all of it out of the file the candidate was about to
upload anyway. It is now section 1, the numbers renumber to match, and
nothing is rebuilt: same panel, same upload box, same handlers.

**One Home per header.** A Home chip is injected into every header by a
script of its own. Where the header already had one, that left two
controls with one destination side by side — the public nav has read
"Home … Home" ever since. The rule is now: keep whichever Home is always
visible, and where both are, keep the page's own. So the public site
keeps its nav item and loses the chip; the candidate portal keeps the
chip and loses the duplicate buried in the profile dropdown.

Both were timing bugs as much as layout ones: the chip mounts from its own
script, usually *after* the render hook runs, so the first attempt found
nothing and gave up. It now waits once and tries again, which is what
makes the fix land on the first paint — the only paint most people see.

npm run rehearse          24/24  a deployment against an empty database
npm run ui:compare baseline clean     58/80 identical, 22 explained below
```

### Reading the UI comparison

Capture the comparison build against a **clean, seeded database on its own
port**, or the numbers are meaningless:

```
rm -rf var/fidelity-db
LOAD_SEED=true DEV_DB_DIR=$PWD/var/fidelity-db PG_PORT=5436 node tools/dev-server.mjs 4325
TL_URL=http://localhost:4325/ npm run ui:capture clean
npm run ui:compare baseline clean
```

A development database that has had the verifiers run against it holds
hundreds of extra candidates and applications, and the recruiter screens
then differ by thousands of nodes — which is data volume, not design, but
the harness cannot tell the difference and reports LAYOUT changed for
every list in the product. Without `LOAD_SEED=true` the demo profiles have
no logins and the capture cannot sign in at all.

Every difference in the current comparison is deliberate and requested:

| screens | difference | why |
|---|---|---|
| 16 · every `candidate-*` page, both widths | the header loses `★ Recommended` | asked for: "remove recommended jobs from candidate portal" |
| 2 · `register` | password hint reads "At least 8 characters, with a letter and a number" | the prototype promised 6; the server requires 8 with a letter and a digit, and a form that lies about the rule fails after submission |
| 2 · `login-candidate` | the hard-coded demo credential panel is gone | a real password cannot be printed on the login screen |
| 2 · `client-candidates` | fewer rows | RLS scopes a client to their own company's candidates |

Node counts are identical on `register` (246 → 246) and the layout hash is
unchanged on `candidate-*`: only the nav list and one placeholder differ.

`verify:candidate` is the one that covers the bug above: it walks the whole
candidate journey, then simulates each way a call can fail and asserts the
app names the right one.

Run the whole stack locally — Postgres, API and the app — with:

```
node tools/dev-server.mjs 4323
```

## TeamLink.Enterprise (the ATS) — server-to-server sync

This portal replaced TeamLink.Enterprise's old single-file `/job-portal/`.
TeamLink requirements are its jobs, and its applications are TeamLink
pipeline rows. Code: `api/src/integrations/teamlink.js` (portal side) and
`teamlink-enterprise/backend/src/utils/jobPortalBridge.js` (ATS side).

| direction | call | auth |
|---|---|---|
| ATS → portal | `PUT /api/integrations/teamlink/jobs/:requirementId` — upsert one job | `x-teamlink-token: $JOB_PORTAL_SYNC_TOKEN` |
| ATS → portal | `POST /api/integrations/teamlink/jobs/sync` `{jobs, closeOthers}` — upsert all, close the rest | same |
| ATS ← portal (pull) | `GET /api/integrations/teamlink/applications?since=` | same |
| portal → ATS (push) | `POST $TEAMLINK_API_URL/api/public/job-portal/applications` after every apply | `x-job-portal-secret: $JOB_PORTAL_PUSH_SECRET` |

- A TeamLink job's id is `tl_<requirement id>`, under company
  `TEAMLINK_COMPANY_ID` (default `tmlink`, "TeamLink Consultants"). The client
  is never named on the board.
- The token routes run as the database `admin` role (RLS's admin branch). With
  `JOB_PORTAL_SYNC_TOKEN` unset they answer 503. They need no session, so the
  CSRF guard does not apply to them.
- The push is fire-and-forget after the application commits. It never fails an
  apply. TeamLink pulls the last 30 days of applications at startup, hourly and
  on "Sync", and ingests them idempotently: the candidate is matched by email,
  then phone, and one candidate + requirement is one application.
- A job opened for the first time runs the usual job alerts. A re-sync does not
  send them again.
