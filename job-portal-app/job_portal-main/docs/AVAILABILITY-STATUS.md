# Candidate availability status

Migration `0092_availability_status.sql`, API `api/src/routes/availability.js` and
`api/src/notify/availability-checks.js`, UI `web/teamlink-availability.js`.

The candidate says whether they are looking; recruiter search filters and ranks by it; it is
re-confirmed automatically so it never goes stale.

| Status | Means | Recruiter search | Contact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Actively looking | wants a job now | first, green badge | free |
| Open to offers | has a job, would move for a good offer | second, yellow | free |
| Not looking | not now | hidden by default ("Show all" shows it), grey | warning first: "This candidate said they are not looking (12 Aug)" — continue allowed |
| Placed (automatic) | joined through TeamLink | hidden by default, blue | blocked for other roles for 90 days (replacement period); admin override logged |
| Unknown | never said | after the two above | free |
| Not confirmed | did not answer a re-confirmation in 14 days | ranked below unknown, grey | free |

## Who sets it

**Only the candidate** (or their reply link). A recruiter cannot change it — not through any
route (`PUT /api/candidates/:id/availability` answers 403 for anybody but the candidate) and
not in the database: a trigger refuses any direct write of these columns by the API's role,
including an owning recruiter whose UPDATE would otherwise pass row level security. Every
write goes through definer functions:

| Source | When |
|---|---|
| `register` | the registration form asks "Are you looking for a job?" (default Actively looking) |
| `candidate` | the status bar on the candidate's profile: one tap, plus "can join in", preferred roles, preferred cities |
| `reply_link` | the "Still looking?" message's links — no login |
| `apply` | applying while Not looking or Unknown → Actively looking (applying while looking counts as a confirmation) |
| `system` | joined → Placed; Placed for 90 days → Not looking (+ one "Looking for a new role?" message); the backfill |

A recruiter who hears something different on a call writes it in **Log call**.

**Can join in** (Immediate / 15 / 30 / 60 / 90 days) is the notice period said the other way:
editing either updates the other.

`candidates.availability` already existed (0057: free text on the manual entry form), so the
new column is `availability_status`; the others are `availability_updated_at`,
`availability_confirmed_at`, `availability_source`, `availability_stale_at` (set = "Not
confirmed"), `availability_placed_at`, `can_join_in`, `preferred_roles`, `preferred_cities`.
History: `candidate_availability_history`. Re-confirm messages: `availability_checks`.

Backfill: candidates who signed in or applied in the last 30 days → Actively looking
(source `system`); joined in the last 90 days → Placed; everyone else Unknown.

## Re-confirmation ("Are you still looking for a job?")

**Off until you turn it on.** The re-confirm messages, and the one message
sent when a placed candidate's 90 days end, go out only when the server
has `AVAILABILITY_RECONFIRM_MESSAGES=true`. The backfill marks everyone who
signed in or applied in the last 30 days as actively looking. With the
messages on, a large share of real candidates would be asked within the
first weeks. "Not confirmed" bookkeeping runs either way. Turn it on
when you are ready for that stream.


The hourly sweep (`startAvailabilitySweep`, started with the other background work):

* Actively looking not confirmed for **30 days**, Open to offers for **60 days** → asked.
* **At most one message per candidate per 30 days**, nothing to do-not-contact.
* **Never 21:00–08:00 IST** — a night run sends nothing; the next day picks the same people up.
* One channel: **WhatsApp** when an approved template is configured and they opted in, else
  **SMS**, else **email** (the next is tried only if the previous did not send) — and an
  **in-app** notification always. Every channel's own answer is stored on the check.
* Three links: Yes, actively / Open to offers / Not now. Each is a random token with an HMAC;
  only its SHA-256 is stored. The link opens a page served by the API that asks to confirm
  (mail scanners and chat previews open links by themselves; a one-tap confirm keeps them from
  answering for the candidate). **Single-use, 14 days, only that candidate.**
* No answer in **14 days** → "Not confirmed" (the status stays; it shows grey and ranks lower)
  until any answer.
* Placed for **90 days** → Not looking and one friendly "Looking for a new role?" message.
* The messages never name a client.

`POST /api/admin/availability/run` (Admin → Availability → "Run re-confirmation now") runs the
same sweep on demand; it respects quiet hours too.

## Recruiter side

* Badge on Talent Pool rows, Find Candidates cards and the candidate profile, with "can join
  in 15 days" and "updated 3 days ago".
* **Availability** filter on both screens (multi-select: Actively looking, Open to offers,
  Unknown, Not confirmed, Not looking, Placed). With nothing picked the server hides Not
  looking and Placed; **Show all** shows them. The filter runs in SQL
  (`GET /api/candidates?availability=…` / `availabilityAll=true`). A requirement's own list
  (`jobId`) or a stage filter is never filtered by default — that is the pipeline.
* Ranking: with the default (Relevance) sort, `availability_rank()` orders actively looking
  (confirmed) > open to offers > unknown > not confirmed > not looking > placed, then the
  existing order.
* Bulk message skips Not looking by default (a checkbox includes them) and Placed always.
* Placed blocks call / message / add-to-job for another role on the server, through the same
  `can_engage()` as the shared-candidates hold (a joining holds every role for 90 days).

**Clients never see it**: the fields are attached only to recruiter / BDE / admin responses,
and no client route or view reads them.

## Admin report

`GET /api/admin/availability/report` — counts per status (with Not confirmed separated),
re-confirmations sent / answered / unanswered / waiting, by channel and by answer, and the
changes by source, over the last 30 days. Shown on Admin → Availability.

## API

| Method | Path | Who |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/candidate/availability` | candidate |
| PUT | `/api/candidate/availability` `{status?, canJoinIn?, preferredRoles?, preferredCities?}` | candidate |
| PUT | `/api/candidates/:id/availability` | the candidate themselves only (403 for staff) |
| GET | `/api/availability/reply?t=&a=` | anyone with the link (confirm page) |
| POST | `/api/availability/reply` `{t, a}` | anyone with the link |
| GET | `/api/admin/availability/report?days=` | admin |
| POST | `/api/admin/availability/run` | admin |
| POST | `/api/auth/register` gains `availability` | anonymous |
| GET | `/api/candidates` (and `/api/candidates/:id`) gain the `availability` and `availabilityAll` parameters; rows carry `availabilityStatus` and `canEdit` for staff (the older free-text `availability` field from 0057 is unchanged) | recruiter, admin |

## Tests

* `api/test/availability-db.test.mjs` — the rules in Postgres as the API's role.
* `api/test/availability.test.mjs` — routes, search, the sweep with the mock SMS provider,
  the reply page, placed, bulk skips, the report, clients see nothing.
* `tools/verify-availability.mjs` — Playwright: candidate sets Not looking → recruiter search
  hides them → "Show all" shows a grey badge → candidate applies → recruiter sees green.
